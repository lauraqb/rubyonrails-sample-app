# CHAPTER 7 & 8 - The main purpose of our test is to verify that clicking the signup button results in not creating a new user when the submitted information is invalid.
# The way to do this is to check the count of users, and under the hood our tests will use the count method available on every Active Record class.
# In order to test the form submission, we need to issue a POST request to the users_path.
# Weâ€™ve also included a call to assert_template to check that a failed submission re-renders the new action.
